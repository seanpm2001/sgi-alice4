Use this directory to make changes to the Linux device tree. This was
useful for enabling i2c-2. We got the binary .dtb from the original
flash disk (here as orig.dtb). The Makefile then creates the source.dts
file by reverse-compiling the binary. You can then make changes to
the source (such as changing the third i2c from "disable" to "okay"),
then run make again to generate new.dtb. Run "make install" to copy
these back to the flash disk.
